# Kanter
A node based image editor for texture creation. It uses [Kanter Core](https://github.com/lukors/kanter_core) and [OrbTk](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk).

## Goals
- Responsiveness - It should be fast to start, and snappy to use
- Simplicity - It should be easy to understand and not be bloated with unnecessary nodes or cluttered UI
- Completeness - It should have the tools to generate every kind of texture
