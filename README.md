# Kanter
A node based image editor for texture creation. It uses [Kanter Core](https://github.com/lukors/kanter_core) and [OrbTK](https://github.com/redox-os/orbtk).

# Focus
- Responsiveness - It should be fast to start, and snappy to use
- Simplicity - It should be easy to understand and not be bloated with unnecessary nodes or cluttered UI
- Completeness - It should have the tools to generate every kind of texture

# Current state
I'm currently building the first iteration of the user interface. You can load a graph, move nodes around, and save the graph, that's about it.

# Plans
First I'm going to get a basic usable interface working. Then I'm going to think about what to do next.

Some vague plans I have is to create an addon for Blender so I can use their Eevee renderer as the 3D viewport instead of making my own. Maybe that's next up after the basic GUI is working.
